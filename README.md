# Interactive map to check earthquake data using Google Map API 

## What an user can do with this interactive app

1. Users can obtain a graphical representation of how each earthquake compares to other earthquakes along a certain parameter by entering a keyboard command.

2. If an ocean earthquake marker is clicked, lines are drawn between this marker and all of the cities that may be affected by it.

3. If the user clicks an earthquake marker, *all cities that may be affected by this earthquake are displayed*; when the user clicks a city marker, *all earthquakes that may affect that city are displayed*.

4. Popup information boxes about the earthquakes and cities are always drawn on top of all other graphical information. Information boxes are contained within the map content area.

## What I have used?

* Created an interactive graphical map that displayed geo-spatial data, through Google Map API, using the unfolding maps library and essentials of data cleaning and data visualization. 

* Used core object oriented programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction. 

* Implemented event driven programming and implemented efficient searching and sorting techniques for data to be displayed. 

Please come back later, I will write a detailed documentation on it in my free time.
