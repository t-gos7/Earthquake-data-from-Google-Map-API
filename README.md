# Earthquake data using Google Map API

* Created an interactive graphical map that displayed geo-spatial data, through Google Map API, using the unfolding maps library and essentials of data cleaning and data visualization. 

* Used core object oriented programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction. 

* Implemented event driven programming and implemented efficient searching and sorting techniques for data to be displayed. 

Please come back later, I will write a detailed documentation on it in my free time.
